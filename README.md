# Design Patterns - Learning from "Head First Design Patterns"

This repository contains projects and examples from my study of "Head First Design Patterns." Each chapter in the book is dedicated to a different design pattern, and this repository reflects that structure, with each chapter's code organized into its own folder.

## Project Overview

This repository is a collection of various design patterns implemented as part of my learning journey. Each pattern is explored through practical examples, demonstrating how they can be applied in real-world scenarios.

## Design Patterns Implemented

### 1. **Strategy Pattern**

- **Folder**: `01_strategy-pattern`
- **Description**: The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

### 2. **Observer Pattern**

- **Folder**: `02_observer-pattern`
- **Description**: The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

### 3. **Decorator Pattern**

- **Folder**: `03_decorator-pattern`
- **Description**: The Decorator Pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

### 4. **Factory Pattern**

- **Folder**: `04_factory-pattern`
- **Description**: The Factory Pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.

## How to Run the Projects

### Prerequisites

- **Bun**: Most projects are set up using Bun. Ensure you have it installed.
- **Node.js**: Some projects may also require Node.js.

### Running the Code

1. **Navigate to the chapter folder** you want to explore.
2. **Follow the README instructions** within that folder for specific setup and execution commands.

Example:

```bash
cd 01_strategy-pattern
bun run src/index.ts
```

## Learning Journey

This repository is a reflection of my journey to mastering design patterns. Each folder represents a new challenge and a deeper understanding of how to build scalable, maintainable software using proven design principles.
